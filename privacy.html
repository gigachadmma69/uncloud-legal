        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective date: February 24, 2026</p>

        <p>Uncloud: Quit Vaping ("Uncloud", "the App", "we", "our", or "us") is designed to help you quit vaping. We built this app with your privacy as a core principle. This policy explains what data the App handles, how it is stored, and who can access it.</p>

        <h2>1. Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
        <p>Most data you enter into Uncloud -- including vaping and puff logs, moods, triggers, notes, quit dates, goals, and progress -- is stored locally on your device. The App includes a home screen widget and an optional Apple Watch companion app. To display your progress, data is shared between these components using Apple's App Groups feature. This sharing happens entirely on your device and does not involve any network transmission.</p>

        <h2>2. iCloud Sync</h2>
        <p>If you are signed into iCloud on your device, your puff logs and craving data may be automatically synced across your devices using Apple's CloudKit service. This data is stored in your private iCloud account and is not accessible to us. You can disable iCloud sync in your device's system settings. For details on how Apple handles iCloud data, refer to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>3. AI Coaching Feature</h2>
        <p>Uncloud includes an optional AI coaching feature that provides personalized quit-vaping support. When you use this feature:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your messages and relevant context (streak length, daily puff count, motivation, and general usage patterns) are sent to a third-party AI service (<a href="https://openrouter.ai/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenRouter</a>) to generate responses.</li>
            <li>No personally identifiable information (name, email, location, device ID) is included in these requests.</li>
            <li>Conversation history is stored locally on your device (up to 50 messages) and is not stored on our servers.</li>
            <li>You can clear your conversation history at any time by deleting and reinstalling the App.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The AI coach is a premium feature. Free users may send one message to preview it. You are never required to use this feature.</p>

        <h2>4. Apple HealthKit</h2>
        <p>With your explicit permission, Uncloud may read the following data from Apple Health:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Heart rate and resting heart rate</li>
            <li>Sleep analysis</li>
            <li>Respiratory rate</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This data is used solely to show you how quitting vaping is improving your health. HealthKit data is read on-device and is <strong>never</strong> sent to any external server, shared with third parties, or used for advertising. You can revoke HealthKit access at any time in your device's Health app settings.</p>

        <h2>5. Subscriptions and Payment Processing</h2>
        <p>Uncloud offers optional premium features through subscriptions and a one-time lifetime purchase. Subscription management is handled by <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RevenueCat</a>, a third-party service that communicates with the Apple App Store to manage purchase state.</p>
        <p>When you subscribe, Apple processes your payment. RevenueCat receives a transaction record from Apple to verify your subscription status. We do not have access to your credit card number, billing address, or Apple ID. For details on how RevenueCat handles data, please refer to their <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>6. Analytics</h2>
        <p>Uncloud collects anonymous, aggregated usage events (such as features used, onboarding completion, and subscription status) through RevenueCat's custom attributes. These events contain no personally identifiable information and are used solely to improve the App. We do not use any third-party advertising or behavioral tracking SDKs.</p>

        <h2>7. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>Uncloud does <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Names, email addresses, or account information</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
            <li>Browsing history or cross-app tracking data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Uncloud is not directed at children under the age of 17. We do not knowingly collect any information from children. If you believe a child has provided data through the App, please contact us so we can address the concern.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

        <h2>10. Contact Us</h2>
