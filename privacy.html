        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective date: February 20, 2026</p>

        <p>Uncloud: Quit Vaping ("Uncloud", "the App", "we", "our", or "us") is designed to help you quit vaping. We built this app with your privacy as a core principle. This policy explains what data the App handles, how it is stored, and who can access it.</p>

        <h2>1. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>Uncloud does <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers. Specifically, we do not collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Names, email addresses, or account information</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
            <li>Usage analytics or behavioral tracking data</li>
            <li>Health data beyond what you enter into the App</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
        <p>All data you enter into Uncloud -- including vaping and puff logs, quit dates, goals, and progress -- is stored locally on your device. This data never leaves your device through our App.</p>
        <p>The App includes a home screen widget built with WidgetKit. To display your progress on the widget, data is shared between the App and the widget using Apple's App Groups feature. This sharing happens entirely on your device and does not involve any network transmission.</p>

        <h2>3. Subscriptions and Payment Processing</h2>
        <p>Uncloud offers optional in-app subscriptions. Subscription management is handled by <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RevenueCat</a>, a third-party service that communicates with the Apple App Store to manage purchase state.</p>
        <p>When you subscribe, Apple processes your payment. RevenueCat receives a transaction record from Apple to verify your subscription status. We do not have access to your credit card number, billing address, or Apple ID. For details on how RevenueCat handles data, please refer to their <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party SDKs</h2>
        <p>The only third-party SDK integrated into Uncloud is RevenueCat, used solely for subscription management. We do not use any analytics, advertising, crash reporting, or tracking SDKs.</p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Uncloud is not directed at children under the age of 17. We do not knowingly collect any information from children. If you believe a child has provided data through the App, please contact us so we can address the concern.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
